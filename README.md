## Employee Data Management System

### Project Overview
The Employee Data Management System is a simple yet functional application designed to manage employee data. This project serves as a practice for implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Java. It provides a foundational understanding of how to handle employee records efficiently, showcasing the use of core Java concepts and collections.

### Features
- **Add Employee**: Allows adding new employees with details such as employee name, employee number, and salary.
- **View Employees**: Displays a list of all employees and their details.
- **Update Employee**: Enables updating the details of existing employees.
- **Delete Employee**: Facilitates the deletion of employee records.
- **Search Employee**: Allows searching for employees based on their employee number.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for the application.
- **ArrayList**: Utilized for storing and managing employee data.
- **Getter and Setter Methods**: Used for accessing and modifying employee attributes.
- **Method Overriding**: Implemented for customizing methods according to requirements.

### Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding and implementing CRUD operations.
- Practical experience with Java collections, specifically ArrayList.
- Mastery of getter and setter methods for data encapsulation.
- Experience with method overriding to tailor functionalities.
- Enhancing problem-solving skills through real-world scenario implementation.

### How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
